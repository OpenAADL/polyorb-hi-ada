@noindent
Commands that are entered by the user are preceded in this manual by
the characters @w{``@code{$ }''} (dollar sign followed by space). If
your system uses this sequence as a prompt, then the commands will
appear exactly as you see them in the manual. If your system uses some
other prompt, then the command will appear with the @code{$} replaced
by whatever prompt character you are using.

Full file names are shown with the ``@code{/}'' character as the
directory separator; e.g., @file{parent-dir/subdir/myfile.adb}.  If
you are working on a Windows platform, please note that the
``@code{\}'' character should be used instead.
