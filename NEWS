New Features of PolyORB-HI:

v1.1 (2008-MM-DD): in addition to v1.0:
	- Message PDU maximal size is deduced automatically from each
	node data types (change 5386).
	
	- The transport high level layer is now generated
	automatically for each node (change 5385).

	- New package hierarchy: PolyORB_HI is the root of all
	non-generated services. PolyORB_HI_Generated is the root of
	all generated services (change 5381 and 5382)
	
	- Added support for AADL "timed" threads: periodic threads
	that are also able to respond sporadically to external events
	(changes 5365, 5366, 5367, 5368).

	- Support of AADL threads that are connected with delayed
	connexions (local case only) (changes 5340 and 5358)

v1.0 (2007-10-01): in addition to v0.9:
	- New example, mode_switch to illustrate the thread mode switch
	(change 5280).
	
	- New example, flight_mgmt to illustrate the new communication
	subsystem (change 5275).
	
	- New communication subsystem based on the AADL standard
	requirements. User code is able now to manipulate thread
	interfaces through several runtime routines. These routines are
	provided by the 'PolyORB_HI.Thread_Interrogators' generic which is
	instantiated once for each thread (changes 5261-5274).
	
	- New demo from SEI CMU, SunSeeker, that demonstrates how to build
	a control system using AADL.
	
	- New demo from IST-ASSERT, MPC, that demonstrates how to build a
	replicated system with multiple instantiations of the same threads
	on different nodes
	
	- New demo to test the import of C functions, import
	
	- PolyORB-HI now uses autoconf/automake

v0.9 (2007-03-07): in addition to v0.8:
	- Renamed project to PolyORB-HI
	
	- Split restriction configuration files to support more
	restrictions for GNAT for HI Systems
	
	- Added support for "pragma Priority" for protected objects
	generated by Ocarina
	
	- All examples are now running, tested on both native and LEON
	targets
	
	- Addition of the SOIF/MTS low level transport
	
	- Simplify configuration by using ADA_PROJECT_PATH variable
	
v0.8 (2006-10-25): in addition to v0.7:
	- Petri net model generation and graphical output from AADL models
	are now integrated,
	
	- the D3.1.3-1 Toy Example can now be fully generated using
	Ocarina,
	
	- updating AADL-to-code transformation rules,
	
	- now automatically launches tsim when the compilation is
	complete, and begins the execution of the compiled node
	
v0.7 (2006-09-29): in addition to v0.6:
	- document the API of PolyORB HI,
	
	- many additions to the POlyORB HI user guide,
	
	- now the 'some_types' example is fully generated by Ocarina,
	
	- added toy example from D3.1.3-1, tuned for Ocarina,
	
	- provided a local version of AADL models for ping, for test with
	LEON targets,
	
	- added many new features in generate_ada.sh script to compile,
	check and run each generated nodes,
	
	- default target for makefile is now context sensitive and either
	process the AADL scenario file, or build the application node,
	
	- added support for schedulability analysis from AADL models using
	Cheddar, see the RMA examples for more details,
	
	- packaging now includes a binary version of ocarina, and a
	command line tool based on cheddar to test for schedulability
		
v0.6 (2006-09-18): in addition to v0.5:
	- added more debug information,
	
	- added "erc32" rule to build with GNAT GAP 2006 for ERC32,
	
	- added coding guidelines to the OPM,
	
	- added release and debug build modes,
	
	- added generic packages to ease code generation from Ocarina,
	
	- corrected AADL 'ping' example for direct code generation from
	Ocarina,
	
	- now the 'ping' example is fully generated by Ocarina,
	
	- added the 'producer_consumer' by M. Heitz,
		
v0.5 (2006-08-02): in addition to v0.4:
	- updated all headers to match current licence, 

	- clean up in the tree superstructure.
	
v0.4 (2006-08-02): in addition to v0.3:
	- remove most occurrences of slices,

	- usual code reformatting, update, etc,
     
	- addition of a documentation.

v0.3 (2006-08-01): in addition to v0.2:
	- new "check" rule for makefiles, allow to check for all rules
	defined in par 7.1 of D3.3.1-2/D3.3.1-2 deliverable,
     
	- provide a low layer wrapper for transport mechanism, allowing
	for multi-platform (sockets on native ones, empty on LEON for
	now),
     
	- added support to build with "GNAT for Leon",
     
	- added a local test that does not depend on transport lower
	layer, works with "GNAT for Leon".

v0.2 (2006-07-28): in addition to v0.1:
	- include code reformatting, cleaning and documentation,
	
	- support for more restrictions (see src/gnat.adc),
	
	- new some_types example.
	
v0.1 (2006-07-26): initial prototype of PolyORB HI with
	-distribution features. This initial release illustrates
	deployment features with a simple ping example.
